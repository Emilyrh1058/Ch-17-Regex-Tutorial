# Regex Tutorial - Email Matching

In this tutorial, I will explain how to match email addresses using the following expression: 
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`.

## Summary

A regular expression, or regex, is a set of characters that specify a pattern. Using a regex is mostly used to find patterns within a string, validation, or to find and replace characters. Below, we discuss the components of a regex and walk through how to apply it to matching email addresses.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
If you want to search for a pattern that is at one end of the other, you use <em>anchors</em>. The anchors used here are <strong>"^"</strong> (the starting anchor) and <strong>"$"</strong> (the ending anchor). "^" is only an anchor if it exists in the beginning of an expression and "$" is only an anchor if it is at the end.
